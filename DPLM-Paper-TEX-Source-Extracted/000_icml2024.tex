% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:

\section*{Impact Statement}
Our work on protein generation and representation learning can be used in developing potent therapeutic macromolecues such as antibodies and accelerate the research process of drug discovery. 
Our method may be adapted to other scenarios of computer-aided design, such as small molecule design, material design, and chip design. 
It is also needed to ensure the responsible use of our method and refrain from using it for harmful purposes.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
We thank anonymous reviewers for their insightful feedback. 
We would like to especially thank Dr. Hang Li for insightful discussions on the project and feedback on the manuscript that help shape this study. 
We thank Yi Zhou, Jing Yuan, Dr. Yilai Li and Jiasheng Ye for their valuable comments.
